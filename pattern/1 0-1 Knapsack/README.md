# Introduction
Given the weights and profits of ‘N’ items, we are asked to put these items in a knapsack which has a capacity ‘C’. 
The goal is to get the maximum profit from the items in the knapsack. Each item can only be selected once, as we don’t 
have multiple quantities of any item.

# Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays to represent weights and profits of ‘N’ items, we need to find a subset of these items which will 
give us maximum profit such that their cumulative weight is not more than a given number ‘C’. Each item can only be selected 
once, which means either we put an item in the knapsack or we skip it.

### Basic Solution
A basic brute-force solution could be to try all combinations of the given items 

```
for each item 'i' 
  create a new set which INCLUDES item 'i' if the total weight does not exceed the capacity, and 
     recursively process the remaining capacity and items
  create a new set WITHOUT item 'i', and recursively process the remaining items 
return the set from the above two sets with higher profit 
```
### Brute force code
```
class Knapsack {

  public int solveKnapsack(int[] profits, int[] weights, int capacity) {
    return this.knapsackRecursive(profits, weights, capacity, 0);
  }

  private int knapsackRecursive(int[] profits, int[] weights, int capacity, int currentIndex) {
    // base checks
    if (capacity <= 0 || currentIndex >= profits.length)
      return 0;

    // recursive call after choosing the element at the currentIndex
    // if the weight of the element at currentIndex exceeds the capacity, we shouldn't process this
    int profit1 = 0;
    if( weights[currentIndex] <= capacity )
        profit1 = profits[currentIndex] + knapsackRecursive(profits, weights,
                capacity - weights[currentIndex], currentIndex + 1);

    // recursive call after excluding the element at the currentIndex
    int profit2 = knapsackRecursive(profits, weights, capacity, currentIndex + 1);

    return Math.max(profit1, profit2);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Knapsack ks = new Knapsack();
    int[] profits = {1, 6, 10, 16};
    int[] weights = {1, 2, 3, 5};
    int maxProfit = ks.solveKnapsack(profits, weights, 7);
    System.out.println("Total knapsack profit ---> " + maxProfit);
    maxProfit = ks.solveKnapsack(profits, weights, 6);
    System.out.println("Total knapsack profit ---> " + maxProfit);
  }
}
```

### Top-down Dynamic Programming with Memoization 
Since we have two changing values (capacity and currentIndex) in our recursive function knapsackRecursive(), we can use a two-dimensional array to store the results of all the solved sub-problems. As mentioned above, we need to store results for every sub-array (i.e. for every possible index ‘i’) and for every possible capacity ‘c’.

```
class Knapsack {

  public int solveKnapsack(int[] profits, int[] weights, int capacity) {
    Integer[][] dp = new Integer[profits.length][capacity + 1];
    return this.knapsackRecursive(dp, profits, weights, capacity, 0);
  }

  private int knapsackRecursive(Integer[][] dp, int[] profits, int[] weights, int capacity,
      int currentIndex) {

    // base checks
    if (capacity <= 0 || currentIndex >= profits.length)
      return 0;

    // if we have already solved a similar problem, return the result from memory
    if(dp[currentIndex][capacity] != null)
      return dp[currentIndex][capacity];

    // recursive call after choosing the element at the currentIndex
    // if the weight of the element at currentIndex exceeds the capacity, we shouldn't process this
    int profit1 = 0;
    if( weights[currentIndex] <= capacity )
        profit1 = profits[currentIndex] + knapsackRecursive(dp, profits, weights,
                capacity - weights[currentIndex], currentIndex + 1);

    // recursive call after excluding the element at the currentIndex
    int profit2 = knapsackRecursive(dp, profits, weights, capacity, currentIndex + 1);

    dp[currentIndex][capacity] = Math.max(profit1, profit2);
    return dp[currentIndex][capacity];
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Knapsack ks = new Knapsack();
    int[] profits = {1, 6, 10, 16};
    int[] weights = {1, 2, 3, 5};
    int maxProfit = ks.solveKnapsack(profits, weights, 7);
    System.out.println("Total knapsack profit ---> " + maxProfit);
    maxProfit = ks.solveKnapsack(profits, weights, 6);
    System.out.println("Total knapsack profit ---> " + maxProfit);
  }
}
```

### Bottom-up Dynamic Programming

Let’s try to populate our dp[][] array from the above solution, working in a bottom-up fashion. Essentially, we want to 
find the maximum profit for every sub-array and for every possible capacity. This means, dp[i][c] will represent the 
maximum knapsack profit for capacity ‘c’ calculated from the first ‘i’ items.

So, for each item at index ‘i’ (0 <= i < items.length) and capacity ‘c’ (0 <= c <= capacity), we have two options:

1.Exclude the item at index ‘i’. In this case, we will take whatever profit we get from the sub-array excluding this item => dp[i-1][c]

2.Include the item at index ‘i’ if its weight is not more than the capacity. In this case, we include its profit plus whatever profit we get from the remaining capacity and from remaining items => profit[i] + dp[i-1][c-weight[i]]

Finally, our optimal solution will be maximum of the above two values:


dp[i][c] = max (dp[i-1][c], profit[i] + dp[i-1][c-weight[i]])
    

```
class Knapsack {

  public int solveKnapsack(int[] profits, int[] weights, int capacity) {
    // basic checks
    if (capacity <= 0 || profits.length == 0 || weights.length != profits.length)
      return 0;

    int n = profits.length;
    int[][] dp = new int[n][capacity + 1];

    // populate the capacity=0 columns, with '0' capacity we have '0' profit
    for(int i=0; i < n; i++)
      dp[i][0] = 0;

    // if we have only one weight, we will take it if it is not more than the capacity
    for(int c=0; c <= capacity; c++) {
      if(weights[0] <= c)
        dp[0][c] = profits[0];
    }

    // process all sub-arrays for all the capacities
    for(int i=1; i < n; i++) {
      for(int c=1; c <= capacity; c++) {
        int profit1= 0, profit2 = 0;
        // include the item, if it is not more than the capacity
        if(weights[i] <= c)
          profit1 = profits[i] + dp[i-1][c-weights[i]];
        // exclude the item
        profit2 = dp[i-1][c];
        // take maximum
        dp[i][c] = Math.max(profit1, profit2);
      }
    }

    // maximum profit will be at the bottom-right corner.
    return dp[n-1][capacity];
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Knapsack ks = new Knapsack();
    int[] profits = {1, 6, 10, 16};
    int[] weights = {1, 2, 3, 5};
    int maxProfit = ks.solveKnapsack(profits, weights, 7);
    System.out.println("Total knapsack profit ---> " + maxProfit);
    maxProfit = ks.solveKnapsack(profits, weights, 6);
    System.out.println("Total knapsack profit ---> " + maxProfit);
  }
}
```
