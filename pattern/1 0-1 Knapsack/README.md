# Introduction
Given the weights and profits of ‘N’ items, we are asked to put these items in a knapsack which has a capacity ‘C’. 
The goal is to get the maximum profit from the items in the knapsack. Each item can only be selected once, as we don’t 
have multiple quantities of any item.

# Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays to represent weights and profits of ‘N’ items, we need to find a subset of these items which will 
give us maximum profit such that their cumulative weight is not more than a given number ‘C’. Each item can only be selected 
once, which means either we put an item in the knapsack or we skip it.

### Basic Solution
A basic brute-force solution could be to try all combinations of the given items 

```
for each item 'i' 
  create a new set which INCLUDES item 'i' if the total weight does not exceed the capacity, and 
     recursively process the remaining capacity and items
  create a new set WITHOUT item 'i', and recursively process the remaining items 
return the set from the above two sets with higher profit 
```
### Brute force code
```
class Knapsack {

  public int solveKnapsack(int[] profits, int[] weights, int capacity) {
    return this.knapsackRecursive(profits, weights, capacity, 0);
  }

  private int knapsackRecursive(int[] profits, int[] weights, int capacity, int currentIndex) {
    // base checks
    if (capacity <= 0 || currentIndex >= profits.length)
      return 0;

    // recursive call after choosing the element at the currentIndex
    // if the weight of the element at currentIndex exceeds the capacity, we shouldn't process this
    int profit1 = 0;
    if( weights[currentIndex] <= capacity )
        profit1 = profits[currentIndex] + knapsackRecursive(profits, weights,
                capacity - weights[currentIndex], currentIndex + 1);

    // recursive call after excluding the element at the currentIndex
    int profit2 = knapsackRecursive(profits, weights, capacity, currentIndex + 1);

    return Math.max(profit1, profit2);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Knapsack ks = new Knapsack();
    int[] profits = {1, 6, 10, 16};
    int[] weights = {1, 2, 3, 5};
    int maxProfit = ks.solveKnapsack(profits, weights, 7);
    System.out.println("Total knapsack profit ---> " + maxProfit);
    maxProfit = ks.solveKnapsack(profits, weights, 6);
    System.out.println("Total knapsack profit ---> " + maxProfit);
  }
}
```
